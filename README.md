## Skills

#### Communication 
- Working as a primary school teacher, not only did I have to explain concepts clearly to children, but I also had to communicate effectively with Teaching Assistants, parents, senior leadership, OFSTED, social workers and many others.  
- I have further developed these communication skills when working on technical projects at Makers, most specifically giving and receiving feedback and questioning.  
- After living in Spain for four years, I gained a Certificate of Spanish Proficiency from the Instituto Cervantes and can communicate fluently in verbal and written Spanish, both formally and informally.  

#### People & Organisation skills 
- As a teacher and as a developer, I can effectively de-escalate personal disagreements and resolve conflicts effectively.
- I am an advocate for equality and have the confidence to approach difficult subjects when they arise.  
- While at Makers, I have organised self-led activities such as shared viewings of technical videos, self-led retrospectives, whole-team lunch outings etc.  


#### Independence & self-sufficiency
- As a private language tutor, I effectively ran a small business, maintaining positive relationships with clients, dealing with financial transactions/negotiations in addition to consistently carrying out work to the highest standard which in turn led to many word-of-mouth referrals.  
- Using technical skills learned at Makers, I can independently debug code by identifying the specific location of the breakdown and gaining visibility of the problem.
- On the Makers Acebook challenge, my pair partner and I were able to work together to rectify several technical issues/difficulties without having to request assistance from our teammates/coaches.
