## Greg Paul 

My life consists of trying to learn every possible inane expression in Spanish so that one day, one person might actually think I'm a native Spaniard, rather than a try-hard Mancunian.   

## Skills

#### Communication & Language

What first attracted me to coding was the idea of having mastered the language of the humans, then maybe this time I should dedicate myself to the language of the machines.  As you may well be doing with me at this very moment,  I instantly assess the competence of an organisation based on the language it uses to express itself and explain its mission.  I know that my technical and expressive skills can be of great use.
